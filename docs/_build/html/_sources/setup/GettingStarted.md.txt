# Introduction
The package is distributed through both GitHub Releases and GitHub Packages. 

## GitHub Releases / WPILib Vendordeps
[Add the package to vendor libraries](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html) in your project's build.gradle.

```


## Requirements
WhatTime was designed for the 2026 FRC season and later. Certain classes support 2025 by using older versions.
```{note}
If something says it has a minimum version of v0.1.1, then it supports WPILib 2025.
